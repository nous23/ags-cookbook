# Examples

This directory contains runnable AGS examples. Each example keeps its own README and Makefile so users can enter a single directory and follow one local path.

## How to choose an example

### Starter

- `mini-rl` — minimal code-sandbox tool-calling flow
- `hybrid-cookbook` — minimal Go control-plane + data-plane flow
- `html-processing` — dual-sandbox collaboration with visible output artifacts

### Advanced

- [`agent-registry-multi-agent`](./agent-registry-multi-agent/README.md) — discover five governed A2A agents through Agent Registry and invoke them from DeepSeek Harness
- `browser-agent` — browser automation agent with an OpenAI-compatible LLM backend
- `data-analysis` — multi-context data workflow with multiple generated artifacts
- [`deployment-cookbook`](./deployment-cookbook/README.md) — Deployment management with `agr`, from httpbin basics and a native MCP server to a persistent agent workspace
- `dind` — self-starting Docker-in-Docker Tool that runs a real Terminal-Bench Compose task with Harbor Oracle
- `envd-oci-env` — preserve OCI image environment variables when envd is PID 1
- `github-actions-sandbox` — evaluate candidate code in AGS from GitHub Actions and collect test reports
- `harness-nix-volume` — package a self-contained Harness runtime with Nix and mount it into a custom image
- `mini-swe-agent` — SWE-bench evaluation with AGS SWE sandbox and SWE-ReX runtime
- `mobile-use` — Android / Appium automation in AGS
- `openclaw-cookbook` — run OpenClaw in AGS with official image, local management UI and COS persistence
- `shop-assistant` — browser shopping-flow automation with optional cookies
- `custom-image-go-sdk` — custom-image startup and data-plane execution in Go

### Heavy / external-dependent

- `osworld-ags` — overlay for upstream OSWorld; requires a separate checkout, Python 3.12.12, and an OSWorld-capable AGS tool
- `waa-ags` — overlay for upstream Windows Agent Arena; requires a separate checkout, a WAA-compatible AGS sandbox template, and an OpenAI-compatible model endpoint

## Shared local contract

Where practical, each example provides:

- `make setup` for dependency bootstrap
- `make run` for the primary local execution path
- `README.md` for prerequisites, environment variables, run steps, and expected results

Some heavier or externally overlaid examples are exceptions, but they should still document a single primary local path.
